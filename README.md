# Machine Learning in Nanomaterial Biocompatibility Assessment (2023-2025) project

## Abstract, vision and goals
The goal of this project is to propose and construct a machine learning pipeline to process the data handed by the Central European Institute of Technology at Masaryk University. As the nature of the collected data is functional, this project should employ methods from functional data analysis, deep learning and potetially use either differential geometry or topological data analysis to enrich the research. To find out more, look over at the [wiki](https://github.com/xpetitt123/Ceitec/wiki).

## Project status
The project is still in early development, mostly focusing on exploratory analysis and experimentation. To join the methodology discussion, look over at this [board](https://github.com/xpetitt123/Ceitec/discussions/1).

## Technical note

**Note:** Do not modify folder name unless you are sure of what you are doing. The project makes use of Nix and the Nix package manager for the sake of reproducibility. The `default.nix` file that is located in `01_project_management` can be cloned to build the research environment that is used here.
